People came together in raw, unfiltered spaces to experience freedom through rhythm — a kind of organised chaos where hierarchy dissolved, and community took over.",

          "Today, festivals like Freaks of Nature carry that legacy forward — not by replicating the past, but by redefining what it means to belong.",
